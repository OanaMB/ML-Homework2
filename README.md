# ML-Homework2
This homework aims to design neural network architectures that can automatically extract features and use them for the classification of fruits and fashion items from the databases Fashion-MNIST and Fruits-360. There are 4 methods by which this is achieved: MLP on the features extracted in stage 1, with preprocessing algorithms, MLP architecture applied directly to images, Convolutional architecture and Using a finetuning procedure on the ResNet-18 architecture.
